# Cab-Fare-Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting cab fare prices based on various features using machine learning algorithms. The model has been trained on a dataset containing historical cab fare data, and it aims to provide accurate fare estimates based on input parameters like pickup and drop-off locations, time, and distance.

## 1. datasets 
Contains the training and testing datasets used in this project.

train.csv: Dataset used to train the model.
test.csv: Dataset used for model evaluation.

## 2. notebooks
Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.

exploratory_analysis.ipynb: Includes the initial data exploration, visualization, and feature analysis.
model_training.ipynb: Details the model development process, including feature engineering, model selection, and training.

## 3. src
Contains Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and model development.

data_preprocessing.py: Script for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data.
feature_engineering.py: Script for generating and selecting features for the model.
model.py: Contains the machine learning model training and evaluation code.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
